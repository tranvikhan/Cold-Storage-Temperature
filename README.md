## Description
Nowadays, with the development of Industry 4.0, especially the Internet Of Thing (IoT), the application of high technologies to monitoring and managing cold storage temperature is effective and essential. Because the uneven cold storage temperature distribution affects the quality of storage of the food in the cold storage, simulating the temperature distribution of the cold storage in software to adjust the food layout in the cold storage  is necessary. Sensor networks are used in temperature measurement at essential locations in cold storage. The software uses these measurement data in combination with the location information of sensors to simulate temperature in three dimensions. Interpolation method is applied to interpolate temperature data at locations without sensors installed with the best average error approximately 0.72 oC in the experimental layout of the topic. Successful constructions of Web services provide Apis for designing cross-platform applications, and at the same time successfully building application software deployed on Web and Android mobile platforms. The topic has met the functional requirements of users in real-time continuous cold storage temperature management and monitor, and it simulates the cold storage temperatures in three dimensions.
